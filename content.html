      <p>
        Watt measures your energy output and is a measure of how hard you work. Watt measures your performance instantly whereas
        heart rate only shows how hard it feels for your body, and it has a delay of up to several minutes. Heart rate can
        be affected by other external factors such as room temperature, stress, time of day and other variables. Therefore,
        watt is a more precise metric. You can follow your progress by seeing how the watt you can output at a given heart
        rate change over time.

        This is a number cyclists are particularly interested in. Your speed uphill is mainly dependent on how many watts you can
        put into your pedals per kg of body weight. Professionals can go up to 6 watts/kg over 20 minutes while untrained
        riders usually deliver around 2 watts/kg.

        The phone needs to pick up the vibrations from the bike in order to calculate your cadence. For that to work, the phone needs

        The group display can show either the cadence, heart rate, or cycling power (if you have a Bluetooth heart rate or power
        monitor connected in the app) of your team. This is perfect if you want to have an overview of the entire team and
        how they are performing. There is also a team mode that focuses on the team rather than the individuals. Here, you
        can, for example, see how well the team is synced (based on cadence measurements).

        You will need the following to use the group display.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A computer or tablet connected to the internet.</li>
        <li>The Google Chrome web browser (

      <p>
        Make sure the phone is mounted correctly. The phone needs to pick up the vibrations from the bike in order to calculate your
        cadence. For that to work, the phone needs to be placed on the handlebars of the bike in a stable and forward pointing
        position. If the phone is too wobbly, the signals will get corrupted and you will get a wrong cadence measurement.
        Use an official phone mount for your bike, or contact us for help finding a 3. party mount that will work. The quality
        of your cadence data also depends on the sensors in your phone. All iPhones work fine, but some lower end android
        phones without gyro give more noise results. Search for the phone model on
        <a href="www.phonearena.com">www.phonearena.com</a> and look for Gyroscope (typically next to Accelerometer, under phone features). In general,
        the app still works without a gyro, but phone mounting becomes even more important. If you have a very bad internet
        connection, you might also get holes in your data, and the cadence data you do get will be of low quality: contact
        Motosumo to debug if the internet connection could be an issue.

        Make sure location is enabled. Make sure you have selected the correct gym and activity (heart rate or bike) on the "start
        recording" screen. If you still can't see your team, select your gym manually by clicking the selected location (even
        if it looks right on the "start recording" screen). It can be done by selecting another gym and the picking the right

        This is probably due to the quality of the internet connection. Try connecting to the gym wifi, or try using mobile data.
        You can ask your gym manager for a dedicated wifi for group training. Here at Motosumo we might not be able to do
        much about it, but we would be very happy if you would drop a mail to
        <a href="mailto:support@motosumo.com">support@motosumo.com</a>. Please include the email address you use for signing up in the app, the time and geographical

        Yes, we will try to fix the bug, but there are some things you can do to help us, and some things you can try to do to resolve
        the issue yourself. First, send an email to
        <a href="mailto:support@motosumo.com">support@motosumo.com</a> to inform us about the problem, even if we are already aware of the problem it is helpful
        for us to get more information about who is having the problem, and what triggered it. Include the following information
        in the email: Describe the problem. What happened immediately before the problem occurred the first time (did you
        do something unusual, did the app update, anything you think could have triggered the crash), your email address
        you used for signing up in the app, the phone make and model, when you experienced the problem the first time, A
        screenshot of the problem (if possible). Try to delete the app data: instructions for
        <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-clear-app-cache-and-app-data-in-android-6-0-marshmallow/">android 6.0</a>,
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-clear-cache-your-iphone-ipad-appzoro-technologies-inc-/">iOS</a>, and restarting the app. This will require you to sign in to the app again. Delete the app and reinstall
        it from the play or app store. Hang tight, if you have emailed us a description of the crash, we will let you know
        if we have found and fixed the bug in the app.

        Make sure Bluetooth is turned on, on your phone. Try closing the app and turning Bluetooth off and on again making sure your
        phone "sees" the device when scanning. Make sure you haven't paired with the device from another device (or someone
        else has), another app on your phone, or in the system Bluetooth settings on your phone os. Check that the device
        is Bluetooth 4.0 or Bluetooth LE compatible. Some devices, such as the Fitbit, apple watch, etc. are not standard
        bluetooth devices, and we don't support them yet. Feel free to drop a mail to
        <a href="mailto:support@motosumo.com">support@motosumo.com</a> to inform us that you are having issues with your device. Describe the exact make and model

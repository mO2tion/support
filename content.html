      <p>
        Watt measure your energy output and is a measure of how hard you work. Watt measures your performance instantly whereas heart
        rate only shows how hard it feels for your body, and it has a delay of up to several minutes. Heart rate can be affected
        by other external factors such as room temperature, stress, time of day and other variables. Therefore, watt is a
        more precise metric. You can follow your progress by seeing how the watt you can output at a given heart rate change
        over time.

        This is a number cyclists are particularly interested in. Your speed uphill is mainly dependent on how many watt you can

          Currently, the big screen team display is only supported in the Google Chrome browser. You can download it for free here:

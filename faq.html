  <h2 id="what-is-watt-power">What is watt (power)?</h2>
  <p>Watt measure your energy output and is a measure of how hard you work. Watt measures your performance instantly whereas heart rate only shows how hard it feels for your body, and it has a delay of up to several minutes. Heart rate can be affected by
    other external factors such as room temperature, stress, time of day and other variables. Therefore, watt is a more precise metric. You can follow your progress by seeing how the watt you can output at a given heart rate change over time.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-ftp">What is FTP?</h2>
  <p>FTP is your Functional Threshold Power. This is the maximum watt you can deliver for one hour. If you don’t know your FTP, you can consult
    <a href="https://body-bike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/FTP-ENG.jpg" target="_top">this approximate table</a>. You can also take a 5 minute test at full power seated and multiply the average power by 0.82 to get your FTP.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-wattweight">What is watt/weight?</h2>
  <p>This is a number cyclists are particularly interested in. Your speed uphill is mainly dependent on how many watt you can put into your pedals per kg of body weight. Professionals can go up to 6 watt/kg over 20 minutes while untrained riders usually
    deliver around 2 watt/kg.</p>

  <h2 id="as-an-instructor-how-can-my-data-be-shared-live-with-the-rest-of-the-team">As an instructor, how can my data be shared live with the rest of the team?</h2>
  <p>We can show your data as a special line on the recording screen to make it easier for the rest of the team to follow your lead. Just let us know on
    <a href="mailto:support@motosumo.com" target="_top">support@motosumo.com</a> that you are an instructor and we will make sure to set it up for you. When that is done, you will get access to a special instructor button in the app that allows you to toggle your data on and off for the rest of the team.
  </p>
  <h2 id="why-does-motosumo-need-access-to-the-internet-to-work">Why does Motosumo need access to the internet to work?</h2>
  <p>To translate the signals from your phone into a cadence value, they need to be processed by our algorithm in the cloud. So, to allow the signals to be sent to the cloud and the cadence back to the phone, Motosumo needs access to an internet connection.
  </p>
  <h2 id="how-should-i-position-my-phone-on-the-bike">How should I position my phone on the bike?</h2>
  <p>The phone needs to pick up the vibrations from the bike in order to calculate your cadence. For that to work the phone needs to be placed on the handlebars of the bike in a stable and forward pointing position. If the phone is too wobbly, the signals
    will get corrupted and you will get a wrong cadence measurement.</p>
  <h2 id="why-does-the-fixture-on-the-bike-matter">Why does the fixture on the bike matter?</h2>
  <p>Motosumo uses the vibrations of the bike to calculate your cadence. In order to pick up those signals, the fixture for your phone has to be of a certain quality in order to give a seamless experience. Most importantly, the phone has to be put in a stable
    position (i.e., not wobbly) and point forward.</p>
  <h2 id="how-can-i-avoid-incoming-calls-when-training">How can I avoid incoming calls when training?</h2>
  <p>If you wish to avoid incoming calls while you are training, you can activate "Do not disturb" on your phone. Here's how do to it:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>iPhone:</strong> Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open up Control Center. There, click on the "Do not disturb" icon (it looks like a crescent moon). Remember to switch it off again when you're done training!</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Android:</strong> Swipe down from the top of the screen to open up "Quick Settings". In the top bar of icons, activate "Do not disturb" (the icon is a circle with a horizontal line inside it). To access the "Do not disturb" option in the Quick
    Settings menu, you might have to expand the menu and/or swipe to see additional settings. </p>
  <h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-do-not-disturb-and-flight-mode">What is the difference between "Do not disturb" and "Flight mode"?</h2>
  <p>"Do not disturb" will block incoming calls so you can train without being disturbed. "Flight mode" will block all data access which means Motosumo will stop working. If you wish to avoid disturbances while using Motosumo, always use "Do not disturb",
    not "Flight mode".</p>

  <h1 id="app">App </h1>
  <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a>
  <h2 id="how-can-i-change-between-heart-rate-in-beats-per-minute-bpm-and-percent-of-my-max-heart-rate">How can I change between heart rate in beats per minute (bpm) and percent of my max heart rate?</h2>
  <p>Go to Settings and move the switch next to Heartrate in percent. When switched off, your heart rate will be shown in beats per minute (bpm). When switched on, your heart rate will be shown in percent of your max heart rate. You can set you max heart
    rate under Profile.</p>
  <h2 id="how-can-i-adjust-my-maximum-heart-rate">How can I adjust my maximum heart rate?</h2>
  <p>Go to Profile -&gt; Maximum heart rate and input your maximum heart rate. If you don’t know your maximum heart rate, you can use the approximation maximum heart rate = 220 – your age. For example, if you are 43 years old, your maximum heart rate will
    be 220 – 43 = 177 beats per minute. Under your profile, you can also set other personal details such as birthday, weight, and height.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-my-nickname-used-for">What is my nickname used for?</h2>
  <p>We use your nickname when you are training as part of a group that uses our big screen team display to show for example the heart rate of everyone in the group on a single screen. You can set your nickname to (almost) anything you want,
    including emojis 🚴‍.</p>
  <h2 id="why-does-motosumo-need-to-know-my-location">Why does Motosumo need to know my location?</h2>
  <p>We use your location to automatically team you up with the rest of your class and the instructor. This lets you follow them in the app so it is easier for you to train together. If you have a group display, we also use your location to show the team on that.
    Don’t worry, you can be completely anonymous, and we don’t share your location info with anyone else.
  </p>
  <h2 id="how-do-i-allow-motosumo-to-access-my-location">How do I allow Motosumo to access my location?</h2>
  <p>If you don’t allow Motosumo to access your location info, we won’t be able to team you up with the rest of the class and the instructor and you’ll miss out on all of the fun. To allow Motosumo to access your location, follow these instructions:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>iPhone:</strong> On your phone (not in the app!), go to Settings (gear icon), scroll down and pick Motosumo and then press Location. Under “Allow access to location”, select “While using the app”.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Android:</strong> On your phone (not in the app!), go to Settings (gear icon), scroll down and pick Apps, then find and select Motosumo. Under “App Settings” pick Permissions and switch on “Location”.</p>
  <p>You will probably have to restart the Motosumo app in order for this change to take effect within the app.</p>
  <h2 id="how-does-motosumo-measure-my-cadence">How does Motosumo measure my cadence?</h2>
  <p>Motosumo uses the sensors of your smartphone to measure your cadence while biking. While you bike, the smartphone sensors (the same ones that make sure to rotate your screen) can pick up the vibrations of your bike. These signals are then sent to our
    calculation server where we run them through our cadence algorithm. The result is then returned to your phone and showed on the display. To get proper signals for our cadence algorithm, the phone needs to be securely fastened to the handlebars of
    the bike in a forward pointing and flat position.</p>
  <h2 id="what-are-the-other-lines-on-my-screen">What are the other lines on my screen?</h2>
  <p>You own training values will be shown as a coloured line, corresponding to your current training zone, on the display of your phone. In addition, you will see a band that shows the average cadence of the team (everyone at your location) you’re training
    with. If there is an instructor in your class, then her data can be viewed as an extra line as well. To show the instructor, we will have to register them as such. This only has to be done once. Tell your instructor that the can write to us at
    <a href="mailto:support@motosumo.com" target="_top">support@motosumo.com</a> if they wish to be shown with their own line in the app.</p>

  <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a>
  <h2 id="how-can-i-connect-to-a-heart-rate-monitor">How can I connect to a heart rate monitor?</h2>
  <p>Make sure Bluetooth is activated on your phone. Then press on the record button in the app and then on the button with a heart on it (next to the GO button). Put on your heart rate monitor and select it from the list in the app. You have to wear it to connect. You have successfully connected to your heart rate
    monitor when you see a checkmark next to it on the list. If you can’t see your heart rate monitor on the list after about 10 seconds, then make sure it is switched on and/or try to moisten its connection pads and make sure that the the battery is
    charged.
  </p>
  <h2 id="which-heart-rate-monitors-are-compatible-with-motosumo">Which heart rate monitors are compatible with Motosumo?</h2>
  <p>You can use any heart rate monitor that transmits via Bluetooth. Most modern heart rate monitors will do this. If you are in doubt, you can always write to us at <a href="mailto:support@motosumo.com" target="_top">support@motosumo.com</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="why-cant-i-see-my-heart-rate-monitor-in-the-app">Why can’t I see my heart rate monitor in the app?</h2>
  <p>There are three options for failure:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Check that your heart rate monitor transmits via Bluetooth. If it doesn’t, then you can’t connect it in the app.</li>
    <li>Make sure that your heart rate monitor is switched on. If you have a chest strap, try to moisten the connection pads before wearing it as this will help activating the strap. If you have a heart rate monitor with a switch, make sure the switch is
      on.
    </li>
    <li>Check that the battery is charged. You can always try to change the battery to see if it helps.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If none of the above works, send an email to
    <a href="mailto:support@motosumo.com" target="_top">support@motosumo.com</a> and we will do our best to help you out.</p>
  <h2 id="how-can-i-connect-to-a-bike-powermeter">How can I connect to a bike powermeter?</h2>
  <p>Make sure Bluetooth is activated on your phone. Then press on the record button in the app and then on the button with a lightning on it (next to the GO button). Switch on your power monitor. If you are using a power bike, this is usually done by pedalling. When your power monitor gets shown in the app, select it on
    the list to pair with it. You have successfully connected to your power monitor when you see a checkmark next to it on the list. Typically the name of the bike is shown on a sticker on the bike, often it has a number such as #12.</p>
  <h2 id="which-bike-powermeters-are-compatible-with-motosumo">Which bike powermeters are compatible with Motosumo?</h2>
  <p>You can use any bike power meter that transmits via Bluetooth. Most modern power meters will do this. If you are in doubt, you can always write to us at <a href="mailto:support@motosumo.com" target="_top">support@motosumo.com</a>.</p>

  <h1 id="teamdisplay">Big Screen Team Display </h1>
  <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a>
  <h2 id="what-is-the-big-screen-team-display">What is the big screen team display?</h2>
  <p>The big screen team display offers an opportunity to get a full blown group training experience by displaying training data on a large display. As an instructor, you can use it to coach the team. As a regular member, you can use it to get an overview of how your teammates are doing. The big screen can show either the cadence, heart rate, or power (if you have a bluetooth heart rate or power monitor connected in the app) of the individual members of the team.</p>
  <h2 id="what-does-the-big-screen-team-display-show">What does the big screen team display show?</h2>
  <p>The big screen can show either the cadence, heart rate, or cycling power (if you have a bluetooth heart rate or power monitor connected in the app) of your team. This is perfect if you want to have an overview of the entire team and how they are performing. There is also a group experience version that focus on the team rather than the individuals. Here, you can for example see how well the team is synced (based on cadence measurements) and the teams average 60 sec kcal burn. </p>
  <h2 id="how-do-i-access-the-big-screen-team-display">How do I access the big screen team display?</h2>
  <p>Go to <a href="https://bigscreen.mo2tion.com/" target="_top">https://bigscreen.mo2tion.com/</a> using the Google Chrome browser and log in using the same credentials (email and password) as in the app. The browser will then wait for you to start a new session in the app. When you do so, the browser will display the big screen team display. </p>

  <h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-try-out-the-big-screen-team-display">What do I need to try out the big screen team display?</h2>

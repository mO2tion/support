    <h2 id="how-can-i-connect-to-a-heart-rate-monitor">How can I connect to a heart rate monitor?</h2>
    <p>Make sure Bluetooth is activated on your phone. Then go to Settings -&gt; Pair heart rate monitor. Put on your heart
        rate monitor and select it from the list in the app. You have to wear it to connect. You have successfully connected
        to your heart rate monitor when you see a checkmark next to it on the list. If you can’t see your heart rate monitor
        on the list after about 10 seconds, then make sure it is switched on and/or try to moisten its connection pads and
        make sure that the the battery is charged.</p>
    <h2 id="which-heart-rate-monitors-are-compatible-with-motosumo">Which heart rate monitors are compatible with Motosumo?</h2>
    <p>You can use any heart rate monitor that transmits via Bluetooth. Most modern heart rate monitors will do this.</p>
    <h2 id="why-cant-i-see-my-heart-rate-monitor-in-the-app">Why can’t I see my heart rate monitor in the app?</h2>
    <p>There are three options for failure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Check that your heart rate monitor transmits via Bluetooth. If it doesn’t, then you can’t connect it in the app.</li>
        <li>Make sure that your heart rate monitor is switched on. If you have a chest strap, try to moisten the connection pads
            before wearing it as this will help activating the strap. If you have a heart rate monitor with a switch, make
            sure the switch is on.</li>
        <li>Check that the battery is charged. You can always try to change the battery to see if it helps.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If none of the above works, send an email to
        <a href="mailto:support@motosumo.com" target="_top">support@motosumo.com</a> and we will do our best to help you out.</p>
    <h2 id="how-can-i-change-between-heart-rate-in-beats-per-minute-bpm-and-percent-of-my-max-heart-rate">How can I change between heart rate in beats per minute (bpm) and percent of my max heart rate?</h2>
    <p>Go to Settings and move the switch next to Heartrate in percent. When switched off, your heart rate will be shown in
        beats per minute (bpm). When switched on, your heart rate will be shown in percent of your max heart rate. You can
        set you max heart rate under Profile.</p>
    <h2 id="how-can-i-adjust-my-maximum-heart-rate">How can I adjust my maximum heart rate?</h2>
    <p>Go to Profile -&gt; Maximum heart rate and input your maximum heart rate. If you don’t know your maximum heart rate,
        you can use the approximation maximum heart rate = 220 – your age. For example, if you are 43 years old, your maximum
        heart rate will be 220 – 43 = 177 beats per minute. Under your profile, you can also set other personal details such
        as birthday, weight, and height.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-my-nickname-used-for">What is my nickname used for?</h2>
    <p>We use your nickname when you are training as part of a group that uses our big screen solution (group display) to show
        for example the heart rate of everyone in the group on a single screen. You can set your nickname to (almost) anything
        you want, including emojis 🚴‍.</p>
    <h2 id="how-can-i-connect-to-a-bike-powermeter">How can I connect to a bike powermeter?</h2>
    <p>Make sure Bluetooth is activated on your phone. Go to Settings -&gt; Pair cycle power monitor. Switch on your power monitor.
        If you are using a power bike, this is usually done by pedalling. When your power monitor gets shown in the app,
        select it on the list to pair with it. You have successfully connected to your power monitor when you see a checkmark
        next to it on the list. Typically the name of the bike is shown on a sticker on the bike, often it has a number such
        as #12.</p>
    <h2 id="which-bike-powermeters-are-compatible-with-motosumo">Which bike powermeters are compatible with Motosumo?</h2>
    <p>You can use any bike power meter that transmits via Bluetooth. Most modern power meters will do this.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-watt-power">What is watt (power)?</h2>
    <p>Watt measure your energy output and is a measure of how hard you work. Watt measures your performance instantly whereas
        heart rate only shows how hard it feels for your body, and it has a delay of up to several minutes. Heart rate can
        be affected by other external factors such as room temperature, stress, time of day and other variables. Therefore,
        watt is a more precise metric. You can follow your progress by seeing how the watt you can output at a given heart
        rate change over time.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-ftp">What is FTP?</h2>
    <p>FTP is your Functional Threshold Power. This is the maximum watt you can deliver for one hour. If you don’t know your
        FTP, you can consult
        <a href="https://body-bike.com/sites/default/files/ftp_eng.jpg" target="_top">this approximate table</a>. You can also take a 5 minute test at full power seated and multiply the average power
        by 0.82. Or take a 5min test full power (seated) and multiply the average by 0.82 to get your FTP.</p>
    <h2 id="why-does-motosumo-need-to-know-my-location">Why does Motosumo need to know my location?</h2>
    <p>We use your location to automatically team you up with the rest of your team and instructor. This lets you follow them
        in the app so it is easier to let you train together. If you have a group display, we also use your location to show
        the team on that. Don’t worry, you can be completely anonymous, and we don’t share your location info with anyone
        else.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-do-i-allow-motosumo-to-access-my-location">How do I allow Motosumo to access my location?</h2>
    <p>If you don’t allow Motosumo to access your location info, we won’t be able to team you up with the rest of the team and
        the instructor and you’ll miss out on all of the fun. To allow Motosumo to access your location, follow these instructions:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>iPhone:</strong> On your phone (not in the app!), go to Settings (gear icon), scroll down and pick Motosumo and then
        press Location. Under “Allow access to location”, select “While using the app”.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Android:</strong> On your phone (not in the app!), go to Settings (gear icon), scroll down and pick Apps, then find
        and select Motosumo. Under “App Settings” pick Permissions and switch on “Location”.</p>
    <p>You will probably have to restart the Motosumo app in order for this change to take effect within the app.</p>
    <h2 id="as-an-instructor-how-can-my-data-be-shared-live-with-the-rest-of-the-team">As an instructor, how can my data be shared live with the rest of the team?</h2>
    <p>We can show your data as a special line on the recording screen to make it easier for the rest of the team to follow
        your lead. Just let us know on
        <a href="mailto:support@motosumo.com" target="_top">support@motosumo.com</a> that you are an instructor and we will make sure to set it up for you.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-does-motosumo-measure-my-cadence">How does Motosumo measure my cadence?</h2>
    <p>Motosumo use the sensors of your smartphone to measure your cadence while biking. While you bike, the smartphone sensors
        (the same ones that make sure to rotate your screen) can pick up the vibrations of your bike. These signals are then
        sent to our calculation server where we run them through our cadence algorithm. The result is then returned to your
        phone and showed on the display. To get proper signals for our cadence algorithm, the phone needs to be securely
        fastened to the handlebars of the bike in a forward pointing and flat position.</p>
    <h2 id="why-does-motosumo-need-access-to-the-internet-to-work">Why does Motosumo need access to the internet to work?</h2>
    <p>To translate the signals from your phone into a cadence value, they need to be processed by our algorithm in the cloud.
        So, to allow the signals to be sent to the cloud and the cadence back to the phone, Motosumo needs access to an internet
        connection.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-the-other-lines-on-my-screen">What are the other lines on my screen?</h2>
    <p>You own training values will be shown as a coloured line, corresponding to your current training zone, on the display
        of your phone. In addition, you will see a band that shows the average cadence of the team (everyone at your location)
        you’re training with. If there is an instructor in your class, then her data can be viewed as an extra line as well.
        To show the instructor, we will have to mark them as such. This only has to be done once. Tell your instructor that
        the can write to us at
        <a href="mailto:support@motosumo.com" target="_top">support@motosumo.com</a> if they wish to be shown with their own line in the app.</p>
    <h2 id="why-does-the-fixture-on-the-bike-matter">Why does the fixture on the bike matter?</h2>
    <p>Motosumo uses the vibrations of the bike to calculate your cadence. In order to pick up those signals, the fixture for
        your phone has to be of a certain quality in order to give a seamless experience. Most importantly, the phone has
        to be put in a stable position (i.e., not wobbly) and point forward.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-wattweight">What is watt/weight?</h2>
    <p>This is a number cyclists are particularly interested in. Your speed uphill is mainly dependent on how many Watt you
        can put into your pedals per kg of body weight. Professionals can go up to 6 watt/kg over 20 minutes while untrained
        riders usually are around 2 watt/kg.</p>
    <h2 id="how-should-i-position-my-phone-on-the-bike">How should I position my phone on the bike?</h2>
    <p>The phone needs to pick up the vibrations from the bike in order to calculate your cadence. For that to work the phone
        needs to be placed on the handlebars of the bike in a stable and forward pointing position. If the phone is too wobbly,
        the signals will get corrupted and you will get a wrong cadence measurement.</p>
